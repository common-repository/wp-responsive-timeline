WP Responsive Timeline is a full fledged responsive timeline for your site. 

== Description ==

WP Responsive Timeline is a plugin which takes a simple, extendable approach to display responsive timeline posts on your WordPress powered website. You have to simply create the 'timeline' posts, set the timeline color attribute on the right sidebar and publish. The timeline will populate automatically in chronological order, based on the announcement date.

With version 2.0, a shortcode is introduced using which you can show any post types in timeline format.
To use shortcode add:

`[wp_timeline_post]`

The attributes used here is derived from [WP_Query arguments](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query/ "WP_Query arguments") . So you can use any arguments used there as an attributes.
For example, if I want to get the posts with post types "music", I will insert shortcode as:

`[wp_timeline_post post_type=music]`


Some of the features of WP Timeline:

* Full responsive
